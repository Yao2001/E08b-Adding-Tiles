# E08b-Adding-Tiles

This game is about when the ball hit the tiles and the tiles disappear.
There are five different colors of tiles and they are all in line.
When the ball hit the tiles, the tiles disappear and the ball will keep bouncing until it falls of the paddle.
When the ball falls off the paddle, "Died" will show up on the godot.
